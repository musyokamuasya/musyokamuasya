## A little about me as a developer

### When I spend time on a project, I'm concerned about

- The user needs
- Compromise between speed and maintainability
- Security
- Quality

### A few things that I love doing

- Shipping products - putting quality products in the hands of the user.
- Exploring the limits of what's possible.
- Separating what's important and noise.
- Building for a particular user.
- Leverage over time
